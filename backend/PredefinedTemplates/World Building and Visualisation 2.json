Those who possess the most valuable skills, such as hunting, fishing, and survival skills, hold the most authority. They are respected and looked up to by the rest of the community.\n\nThe head of the community is a skilled hunter who is also knowledgeable about survival in the harsh Arctic environment. He is responsible for making important decisions and leading the community in times of crisis.\n\nThe unexpected aspect of this social and hierarchical structure is that there is no elected leader or formal system of governance.
